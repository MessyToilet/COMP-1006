  * This is the skeleton class provided for a previous year's Assignment 1.
	* <p> 
	* In the provided <code>Find.java</code> file, complete the 
  * <code>locateSequence()</code> method. 
  * For a given target sequence (non-empty array of integers), the method 
  * searches the input array (of integers) to find an occurrence of the 
  * target sequence if it is present. If the sequence is present, the 
  * method returns the array index position of where it starts in the array. 
  * If the sequence is not present, the method returns -1.
